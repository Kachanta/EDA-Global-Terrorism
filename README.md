# Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Terrorism:
This is part of my Data Science internship project at The Sparks Foundation.

## Project Overview:
In this task, I step into the shoes of a security and defense analyst to address the crucial issue of identifying terrorism hotspots. This significant concern requires an approach grounded in data. I begin by Inspecting the data, cleaning up the data, selecting important features, fixing missing values and removing columns with similar infomation to ensure our analysis relies on trustworthy information.

## Exploring Terrorism Data:
At the heart of the analysis is delving into data on terrorist attacks, casualties, the number of people killed and injured, all sorted by year, region, country, city, weapon used, attack type, target type, and more. The goal is to grasp the patterns and trends in terrorism incidents spanning from 1970 to 2017.

## Tools Used
I utilized Python programming in Jupyter Notebook to conduct this in-depth analysis, making use of powerful data analysis libraries like pandas, matplotlib, numpy and seaborn. I also exported the cleaned data and made a powerful interactive visualization in Tableau https://public.tableau.com/views/WorldTerorismAnalysis/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link.
